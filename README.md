# ImageConvertXcode
Convert an image to suit Xcode requirement without 3rd party software

The sample does not pretend to be clever optimized or else.
After all I want to be able to read it at later time without to scratch my head to find out how this works

It is just to demonstrate how to create the 3 images required by Xcode from an original image
              @1x @2x @3x
    the original is untouched!
              
You could had loops and folders to work on multiple files.
You could even as a result create the Xcode file structure to directly import the result.
This is not the script's goal.
